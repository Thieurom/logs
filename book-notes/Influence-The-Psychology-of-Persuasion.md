## Chapter 1: Levers of Influence: (Power) Tools of the Trades

- Humans and animals have an automatic-behavior pattern to be triggered by a single feature of the relevant information in the situation (Click-run). This single feature sometimes can consider valuable because it helps avoid having to spend time, and mental energy analyzing the situations. The disadvantages of automatic responding are of course increases the chance of mistakes, sometimes silly and costly ones.
- The compliance process can be understood in terms of a human tendency for automatic, shortcut responding. Most people have developed a set of trigger features for compliance. For example the “If an expert said so, it must be true” rule.
- Perceptual contrast: If the second item is in presentation differently than the first, we tend to see it more differently than it actually is.
